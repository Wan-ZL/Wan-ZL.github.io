<p>
    I am Zelin Wan, a Ph.D. candidate at 
    <a href="https://nvc.cs.vt.edu" target="_blank">Virginia Tech's Computer Science Department</a>, 
    working in the 
    <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/jicho/index.html" target="_blank">Trustworthy Cyberspace Lab (tClab)</a> 
    specializing in deep learning, game theory, cybersecurity, and network science. My academic foundation was laid with a B.S. in 
    <a href="https://www.cs.arizona.edu" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> 
    and a minor in 
    <a href="https://www.math.arizona.edu" target="_blank">Mathematics</a> 
    from the University of Arizona in 2019, followed by an M.S. in Computer Science from Virginia Tech in 2021.

<p>
    My research, recognized by the nomination for the 
    <a href="https://graduateschool.vt.edu/funding/funding-sponsored-by-the-graduate-school.html" target="_blank">Joseph Frank Hunkler Memorial Scholarship</a> 
    and the College of Engineering Graduate Student Publication Fellowship, has been published in prominent IEEE Journals/Conferences and ACM Conferences. These works primarily focus on projects funded by the 
    <a href="https://arl.devcom.army.mil/" target="_blank">U.S. Army Research Office</a>. 
    Additionally, my professional experience includes internships at 
    <a href="https://www.bytedance.com" target="_blank">ByteDance</a> 
    and 
    <a href="https://i-fusion-i.com" target="_blank">Intelligent Fusion Technology</a>, 
    where I applied advanced machine learning techniques to recommendation systems and AI-driven military aircraft maintenance solutions.
