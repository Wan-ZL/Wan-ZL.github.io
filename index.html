I'm Zelin Wan (万泽林). As a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Virginia Tech and an active ACM member, I'm deeply passionate about the intersection of Machine/Deep Learning, Game Theory, Decision Making under Uncertainty, Agent-based Modeling, and Network Science. With 8 papers already published in IEEE Journals/Conferences, ACM Conference, and more in the pipeline, I'm committed to pushing the boundaries of knowledge and innovation in my field. I'm always eager to collaborate and explore new opportunities that challenge and expand my horizons. Let's connect and explore the future of technology together!
