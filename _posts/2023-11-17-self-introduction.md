title: About me
---

I am Zelin Wan, a Ph.D. candidate at [Virginia Tech's Computer Science Department](https://nvc.cs.vt.edu), working in the [Trustworthy Cyberspace Lab (tClab)](https://people.cs.vt.edu/jicho/index.html) specializing in deep learning, game theory, cybersecurity, and network science. My academic foundation was laid with a B.S. in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.arizona.edu) and a minor in [Mathematics](https://www.math.arizona.edu) from the University of Arizona in 2019, followed by an M.S. in Computer Science from Virginia Tech in 2021.

My research, recognized by the nomination for the [Joseph Frank Hunkler Memorial Scholarship](https://graduateschool.vt.edu/funding/funding-sponsored-by-the-graduate-school.html) and the College of Engineering Graduate Student Publication Fellowship, has been published in prominent IEEE Journals/Conferences and ACM Conferences. These works primarily focus on projects funded by the [U.S. Army Research Office](https://arl.devcom.army.mil/). Additionally, my professional experience includes internships at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com) and [Intelligent Fusion Technology](https://i-fusion-i.com), where I applied advanced machine learning techniques to recommendation systems and AI-driven military aircraft maintenance solutions.

As an ACM member, I am committed to contributing to the academic community. My technical skills range across Artificial Intelligence, Machine/Deep Learning, Data Science, and Network Science, supported by proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, C, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

I am keen on collaborating and exploring new opportunities that challenge and broaden my horizons in the ever-evolving field of technology. Let's connect and explore the future of technology together!
